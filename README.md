1. Project idea (Overview)
   
It is a slideshow-like presentation using AI-generated images for visuals and AI-generated text. My project explores philosophical questions about the impact of human nature towards the future. My aim is to leave the viewer with a feeling of unease and thinking about our relationship with nature and the uncertain future.


2. Process
   
My project started with a map of conceptions. Then, I trained this workbook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ntfbrf9W58f2pwPLJ1407Gu0Bk2BeIfz based on text from The Problems of Philosophy by Bertrand Russell and Ethics by Benedictus de Spinoza (both books I found on Gutenberg.org). I put all text into a document and then picked out phrases that I liked and combined them, keeping editing to a minimum.
Then I generated images using this workbook given the same dataset provided in #3: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B5OMydc5jpHN4SAl8X1XTvSFc_9UI7Yv 
I gave the workbook several prompts about the abstract future of nature and it gave me many interesting results. 
Finally, I put together a presentation using google slides and downloaded it as a PDF.

4. Brief conceptual reflection
   
This project explores ideas of nature and how humans are in relation to their environment. I put images that correspond to the text and the philosophical messages, but everything is abstract and up to the viewer's interpretation. I realized that this PDF book-like format really is best for the viewer to consider the message of the text and images on their own time. There are some times that it is most interesting to go through the images quickly to read the text, and other times when the viewer can spend a lot of time staring at the images and considering what it means for themself. 
There is a creative decision I made with the text on page 19 in which the text that came out of the notebook had a typo for “believe” which made me curious if that error was in the original text or if it was something unique to the process of transforming the text into something generated. I decided to keep it in the presentation because I think it shows that like humans, AI is capable of mistakes. For me, this represents my new idea of how writers can coexist with the new age of generated text, which relates to the idea in the presentation of how nature can coexist with humans. I think that the text speaks to a sense of possibility. There is a threatening feeling in the last few lines of the generated text, but I also felt that the generated text insisted on a sense of hope with the unease.
The title “Man Does Nothing.” comes from the generated text. It has multiple meanings but I interpret it as meaning to represent the hypothetical future in which man does nothing to coexist with the environment and continues to use it.
